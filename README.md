# Code Simplicity Checker

## Overview
The **Code Simplicity Checker** is a Python-based tool designed to help developers identify complex code structures and suggest more straightforward alternatives to enhance readability and maintainability.

## Features
- **Static Analysis**: Scans Python files for complex constructs, nested loops, and overly complicated functions.
- **Recommendations**: Provides suggestions based on the identified complexities, like using built-in functions or breaking down functions into smaller components.
- **Custom Rules**: Users can define their own complexity thresholds and rules to customize the analysis.

## Installation
```bash
pip install code-simplicity-checker
```

## Usage
Run the following command in your terminal to check a Python file for simplicity:
```bash
code-simplicity-checker your_script.py
```
